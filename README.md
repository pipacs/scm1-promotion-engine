# SCM Coding Test 1: Promotion Engine

## Dependencies

* Python (version 2 or 3)

## Running The Unit Tests

```sh
cd <repository_root>
python3 test.py
```

## Notes

The coding instructions document hints that promotions are mutually exclusive. However test data implies that all promotions should be applied.

This code implements the second version (all promotions applied). For mutually exclusive promotions, set ```applyFirstPromotionOnly``` to ```True``` in _promotion_engine.py_.
